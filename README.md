# SoftwareTestingQA

This is Software Testing and QA HW 3,4. This was creating a web interface and using it to extend the application we made in assignment 2.
I used semgrep for my local code analysis, travisCI for my continuous integration, and Heroku to deploy the application.
You can visit the application here: https://software-testing-final.herokuapp.com/

Below is the status of the build according to the latest build from TravisCI
